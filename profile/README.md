k3d is a lightweight wrapper to run k3s (Rancher Labâ€™s minimal Kubernetes distribution) in docker.

k3d makes it very easy to create single- and multi-node k3s clusters in docker, e.g. for local development on Kubernetes.

**k3d is a community-driven project**, which is independent from K3s' vendor, developed by open-source maintainers.
